			<p class="description">This process book describes the steps my team and I took in designing a solution to a problem having to do with the theme, "Surviving College" for our Design Thinking class. The problem my team and I decided to take on was, "University of Washington students don’t have an easy way to find events in the surrounding Seattle neighborhoods when they are outside their on-campus communities because they lack awareness of when, where, and what events are going on around them."</p>
			<p class="description">This website outlines the steps our team took in order to arrive at our final design solution, with a focus on my specific contributions to the project.</p> 
			<p class="description">I will go through the initial problem decision and solution idea generation processes, the difficulties we experienced as we got more detailed about the solution, and how the final design came about.</p>

				<p class="description">The first day we were grouped with our teammates, the in-class activity was to come up with an information problem related to the theme. This was actually one of the harder parts of the assignment because the problem statement would determine what kind of solution we'd design in the end.  During this period, I struggled because I had a tendency to think of solutions first, and then problems that would accompany that solution.</p>
				<p class="description">I thought about what difficulties I've personally experienced as a college student, which is when I thought about the difficulties of exploring the world outside of campus, especially because I am not a Seattle native. I've had multiple experiences, both looking for a specific type of place or event and just looking for something spontaneous and fun to do and I always had difficulty finding exactly what I wanted.</p>
